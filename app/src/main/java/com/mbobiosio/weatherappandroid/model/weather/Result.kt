/*
* A sealed class allows you to represent constrained hierarchies in which an object can only be of one of the given types.
*
* That is, we have a class with a specific number of subclasses. What we get in the end is a concept very similar to an enum.
* The difference is that in the enum we only have one object per type, while in the sealed classes we can have several objects of the same class.
* This difference will allow objects from a sealed class to keep state. This will bring us some advantages that weâ€™ll see in a moment, and also opens the doors to some functional ideas.
